Stale Session
Your session has timed out.
Web applications store information about what you are doing on the server.  This information
is called the
session
.
Web servers must track many, many sessions.  If you
are inactive for a long enough time (usually, a few minutes), this information is discarded to
make room for active users.
At this point you may
restart
the session to continue.
